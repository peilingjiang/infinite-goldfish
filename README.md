# infinite-goldfish

Code for Infinite Goldfish project.

An installation in which goldfishes type *infinite* long string of letters by unconciuosly swimming in a terrarium. The movements of fishes are recorded as photos by means of time-lapse photography and uploaded to a cloud drive. The photos will then by processed with DenseCap and converted to corresponding letters based on fishes' locations. We also wrote an additional function to check words through the generated string and count the valid ones. The project is based on Paspberry Pi and Pi Camera.
